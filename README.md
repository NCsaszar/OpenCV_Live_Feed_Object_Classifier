# Live Object Classification

The Live Object Classification project is designed to provide a live feed object classification training model. It allows users to feed positive and negative images and apply object classification to them in real-time. The project utilizes the Haar cascade classifier to detect objects on any window drawing rectangles on detected
objects in real time.

## Features

- Real-time object classification on live video feed
- Ability to provide positive and negative training images
- Uses the Haar cascade classifier for object detection

## LIBS

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- win32gui
